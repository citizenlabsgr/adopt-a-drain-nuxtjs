# Data

Data is provided by Grand Valley Metropolitan Council's REGIS, or [Regional Geographic Information System](http://www.gvmc.org/regis/index.shtml). REGIS provides a common database, infrastructure, and suite of applications used for spatial data management by our members.  To facilitate a more informed decision making process, twenty cities, townships, and quasi-governmental organizations have joined together to develop REGIS, one of the largest local government multi-participant Geographic Information System (GIS) projects.
